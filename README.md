In the program scripts you may have noticed '#!/usr/bin/python3' line on line number 1. It is
called 'shebang line'. It tells about the path to the executor with which the script needs to
be executed. A shebang line startswith '#!' followed by the path to the executor program. In
the above case it is '/usr/bin/python3'. python3 is the executor program residing in /usr/bin
folder in ubuntu 20.
